🚀 Excited to share my experience using Claude to create this education tool called “KN Learning” – using AI to learn AI. I genuinely believe anyone can learn AI, and my goal is to create a continuous learning mindset and invite more people to upskill by making AI learning accessible for all ages, starting at a very simple level with guided practice.  

Here’s how you can try it out:

• 🤖 “KN Learning – Prompt Engineering Mastery” lessons- [link - https://kneo99.github.io/KN-Learning-Ecosystem/prompt-engineering-mastery-standalone_v1.html ]

• 📚 Beginner & Advanced Reading Practice - [link https://kneo99.github.io/KN-Learning-Ecosystem/read-it-practice_g]– a bonus reading practice tool (for young audience) that was my first step in using simple prompts to create and measure reading accuracy.

These lessons are based on user centric-designed to show that anyone can begin learning Artificial Intelligence—and explore LLMs by comparing their features.   For the reading practice tool, I am introducing a fun reading contents with “gamification,”  so anyone can gently practise and check their reading accuracy.  

If you do try it, I’d love to hear your feedback and see how you might use it for yourself, your teams, or young learners around you. 🙌

🚀 Excited to share my journey building “KN Learning” — an education tool created with Claude, designed to make learning AI accessible for everyone.

I truly believe that anyone can learn AI. My mission is to inspire a continuous learning mindset and invite more people to upskill — starting with simple, guided practice that grows into advanced exploration.

✨ Try it out here:

🤖 KN Learning – Prompt Engineering Mastery Hands-on lessons to explore prompt engineering and understand how LLMs work.

📚 Beginner & Advanced Reading Practice A bonus tool (originally built for young learners) that uses gamified reading content to gently practice and measure reading accuracy.

These lessons are user‑centric by design — showing that anyone can begin learning Artificial Intelligence, compare LLM features, and build confidence step by step. The reading practice tool adds a playful layer of gamification, making literacy and comprehension both fun and measurable.

🙌 If you give it a try, I’d love to hear your feedback — whether you see it helping yourself, your teams, or young learners around you.
