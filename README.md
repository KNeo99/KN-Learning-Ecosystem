KN Learning is a public, browser-based learning ecosystem designed to support continuous education from basic English literacy to advanced topics in information technology, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence.

🌟 Project Overview  
The KN Learning Ecosystem is a free, open initiative that encourages lifelong learning for all, with a special focus on non-native English speakers and beginners in technology.
It grew out of a personal journey where improving English reading and writing unlocked access to global knowledge, IT skills, and advanced studies in AI and cloud computing.

This project exists to help others overcome similar barriers and build confidence step by step.
