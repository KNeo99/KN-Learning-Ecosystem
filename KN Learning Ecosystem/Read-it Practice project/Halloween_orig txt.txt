Halloween traces its origins to the ancient Celtic festival of Samhain, celebrated over 2,000 years ago in what is now Ireland, the UK, and northern France. Samhain marked the end of the harvest season and the beginning of winter. Celts believed that on the night of October 31, the boundary between the living and the dead blurred, and spirits could return to earth.
With the spread of Christianity, Samhain was blended with All Saints’ Day (also called All Hallows’ Day), which was moved to November 1. The evening before became known as All Hallows’ Eve, eventually shortened to Halloween.
Over time, Halloween evolved, especially in North America, where it became associated with costumes, trick-or-treating, pumpkin carving, and festive gatherings. Today, Halloween is celebrated in many countries as a fun holiday with both ancient and modern traditions.
